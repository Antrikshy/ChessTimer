=======

This is a simple front-end-only chess timer web "app". I could not find a pretty looking chess timer online, so I made my own. I plan to keep iterating and make it more mobile-friendly. Feel free to contribute and/or report issues.

Current iteration always at [code.Antrikshy.com/checkmt](http://code.Antrikshy.com/checkmt)

I have used the following third-party libraries in this web app:
* [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [jQ Color](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/) plugin
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
* [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
* [Pushy](http://www.christopheryee.ca/pushy/)

Huge credit to Dylan Raga for [helping out](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/2rhifj/im_looking_for_an_elegant_slicklooking_way_cssjq/cnhlf6a) with the on-click textbox transition.
