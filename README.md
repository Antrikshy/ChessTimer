ChessTimer
==========

This website is currently unbranded and until I do so, the current development version should be accessible at http://antrikshy.github.io/ChessTimer

So far, I have used the following third-party libraries in this web app:
* Pure (CSS)
* jQuery
* jQ Color plugin
* Font Awesome
* Animate.css
* Pushy

Huge credit to Dylan Raga for [helping out](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/2rhifj/im_looking_for_an_elegant_slicklooking_way_cssjq/cnhlf6a) with the on-click textbox transition.
